# Stack and Queue - Animal Shelter Queue

Collaboration with Cisco.

Create a Binary Tree class
Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:
pre order
in order
post order
Each depth first traversal method should return an array of values, ordered appropriately.

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

BigO Time - O(n) since the time scaling is linear based on the size of the input\
BigO Space - O(1) since the size of the input and output does not change.

## Solution

git clone this repository into a desired location.\
Inside the repository, run `npm install`.\
Navigate to the JavaScript folder and run `npm test binary-trees.test.js`
